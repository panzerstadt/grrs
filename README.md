to run

`cargo build`
look at the target folder, where you have an exe file (on windows)
on a cli, paste the absolute path to that exe file
you will see it execute (and error out due to missing arguments)
try pasting the absolute path + two strings separated by space (cli arguments)
it will work and show you what it picked as arguments
